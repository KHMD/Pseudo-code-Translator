<p>Pseudo Code Translator, basically allows the user to write, edit and save pseudo code and also translates it into the equivalent C++ code. This application is meant for learning to program, and to help simplify understanding C++. </p>

<a id="the-need-for-this-project" class="anchor" href="#the-need-for-this-project" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The need for this project</h3>

<p>As mentioned in the synopsis, this application is meant for people learning to program or those learning to write C++. We found that are very few applications (if any), have been developed that help learn a language through pseudo code, of course there are softwares like scratch, which make learning to program easier, but they do not use C++. We found that sometimes, for those who are first time programmers, learning C++ or C, becomes daunting due to the strictly typed nature of these languages, and they end up focusing a lot on learning the syntax, than learning to program, or write logical instructions. To address this issue, we decided to write a program that helps one learn to program, and at the same time, highlight the syntaxes of the language. </p>
